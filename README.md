# Real Time Communication

Real time communication (RTC) techniques implemented in Python.

## Why?

The main reason is to get better understanding on how do RTC techniques work by implementing them in Python programing language.

The project can be interesting for those who want to figure out different RTC flow's and see them with practical examples.
